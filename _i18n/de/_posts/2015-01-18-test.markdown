#### Propaganda incoming...
We’re starting a blog. From time to time, we’re going to deal with different issues all around Freifunk and the KBU-community. Posts are going to appear infrequently.

- This blog is jekyll based. If you’re interested in blogging, file a pull-request for <a href="https://github.com/ff-kbu/website">https://github.com/ff-kbu/website</a>
- It’s not translated by default. Posts will in English (mostly) or German. Hardly anybody will take care of translating ‘em all.
- It’s opinionated and does not reflect a consensus within our community.</li>

Due to technical limitations of jekyll, there will be no comments. Join the <a href="#kontakt">maillinglist</a> if you’re up for discussing things and thinkings.

Cheers, Pirx
